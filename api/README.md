# File-Based Storage System

## Overview
This directory contains the enhanced file-based storage system that replaces the previous in-memory storage, solving the issue where "only one confirmation is shown in the server".

## Problem Solved
- **Before**: Data was stored in memory arrays that were lost on server restart/deployment
- **After**: Data is persistently stored in JSON files that survive server restarts

## Files Created
- `storage.js` - Main storage utility with file operations
- Enhanced `confirmations.js` - API endpoint using file-based storage

## Storage Locations
All data files are stored in `/tmp/confirmation-data/`:
- `confirmations.json` - All user confirmations
- `links.json` - Generated confirmation links and their status
- `webhook-logs.json` - Webhook activity logs
- `webhook-settings.json` - Webhook configuration

## Features
✅ **Persistent Data Storage** - Survives server restarts and deployments
✅ **Multiple Confirmations** - No longer limited to showing only one
✅ **Automatic File Management** - Creates directories and handles errors gracefully
✅ **Backward Compatibility** - Maintains existing API interface
✅ **Safe Operations** - Includes error handling and data validation

## Usage
The storage system is automatically used by the API endpoints. No configuration required.

## Testing
Run the test scripts to verify functionality:
- `/tmp/test-storage.js` - Basic storage operations
- `/tmp/test-full-flow.js` - Complete confirmation flow
- `/tmp/test-persistence.js` - Data persistence verification
