## File Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main confirmation page for students
â”œâ”€â”€ admin.html          # Admin panel for managing confirmations
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # Styling for all pages
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # Core functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ admin.js           # Admin panel functionality
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Example Confirmation Link

```
https://yourdomain.com/?token=abc123def456&name=John%20Doe&email=john%40example.com
```

## Data Storage

- Confirmations are stored in the browser's localStorage
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Data is tied to the specific domain/browser
- For production use, consider implementing a backend database

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with localStorage support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (recent versions)
- Mobile browsers supported

## Security Considerations

- Links contain encoded student information in URL parameters
- Tokens are randomly generated for uniqueness
- No sensitive data is exposed beyond what's necessary for confirmation
- For enhanced security, consider implementing server-side token validation

## Customization

### Styling
- Edit `styles.css` to match your organization's branding
- Modify colors, fonts, and layout as needed

### Content
- Update text in `index.html` to match your specific requirements
- Modify confirmation requirements (participation, photo consent, etc.)

### Data Storage
- Current implementation uses localStorage
- To implement server-side storage, modify the data storage functions in `script.js`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Links not working**: Ensure all files are properly deployed to the web server
2. **Data not persisting**: Check if localStorage is enabled in the browser
3. **Mobile display issues**: Verify responsive CSS is loading correctly

### Browser Requirements

- JavaScript must be enabled
- localStorage must be available
- Cookies must be enabled for proper functionality
